## Project Information
*Minesweeper is a computer game, which uses strategy and the logic of the player. The game starts with a blank grid of squares. Once the player clicks on a location, bombs are randomly placed at different spots on the grid. The point of the game is to determine where all the bombs are located by flagging the square they are in. The only guidance the player gets is if a square is bordering a bomb and the player clicks on it, it will say how many bombs it is bordering. However, once the player clicks on a square with a bomb, the game is lost.
The problem that our group chose was to create the game Minesweeper, and to be inclusive of people's different ability and skill levels we created multiple levels. This way if the player has never played the game or is struggling, they can go to an easier level. The levels are easy, medium, hard and insane, and as the levels get harder, the game will have more bombs. We also wanted to be more inclusive for different people playing and if they like dark mode or light mode better on their computers and phones. This is why we added the option for the player to choose either.
